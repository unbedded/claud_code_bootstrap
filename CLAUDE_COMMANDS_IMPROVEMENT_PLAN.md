# Claude Commands Improvement Plan
## Git-Flow Release Management & Automation

**Context:** After completing Recipe Binder v1.0.0 release, identified several pain points in git-flow release process that could be automated via Claude commands.

**Problem:** Manual git-flow release process is error-prone and requires multiple validation steps that are easy to forget or execute incorrectly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Decision Point: Existing Tools vs Custom Claude Commands**

**Existing mature tools that solve similar problems:**
- **`release-it`** - Industry standard automated releases with plugins
- **`semantic-release`** - Fully automated versioning and releases  
- **`bump2version`** - Version management across multiple files
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD release workflows with extensive marketplace
- **`git-flow` AVH** - Enhanced git-flow with better automation
- **`commitizen`** - Conventional commits and automated versioning

**Key Decision:** Research these tools first before building custom Claude commands. They may already solve 70-80% of our pain points, leaving only the AI-enhanced user experience as the unique value-add.

**Next Steps:** 
1. Evaluate existing tools for our specific git-flow workflow
2. Identify gaps where AI intelligence would add genuine value
3. Decide: integrate with existing tools OR build custom Claude automation

## üéØ **Current Bootstrap Commands Analysis**

**Existing commands in `~/sw/ai/claud_code_bootstrap_python/.claude/commands/`:**

### ‚úÖ **Already Good:**
- `/gitflow-finish` - Basic git-flow completion but lacks validation
- `/plan-release` - Comprehensive release planning (excellent template!)
- `/bump-version` - Semantic version bumping with CHANGELOG
- `/smart-commit` - Intelligent commit message generation
- `/run-tests` - Test execution
- `/check-code` - Code quality validation

### ‚ùå **Missing/Needs Enhancement:**
- **Release process validation** and error recovery
- **Branch synchronization checking** (develop vs main)
- **Tag management** and push automation  
- **Version consistency** validation across branches
- **Post-release cleanup** and verification

## ü§î **Alternative Approach: AI-Enhanced Existing Tools**

Start git-flow release with comprehensive validation: $ARGUMENTS

Required: 
- `<version>` - Target version (e.g., "1.2.0", "2.0.0")

Pre-flight checks:
1. Validate current branch is develop
2. Ensure working tree is clean
3. Check develop is up-to-date with origin
4. Verify version format (semver)
5. Confirm no existing release branches
6. Validate version increment is logical

Actions:
1. Run pre-flight validation
2. Execute `git flow release start <version>`
3. Show release checklist from /plan-release
4. Display next steps and warnings

Safety features:
- Prevents starting release from wrong branch
- Catches common version numbering mistakes
- Shows clear rollback procedures if needed
```

### 2. `/release-finish VERSION`
**Purpose:** Complete git-flow release with comprehensive validation and cleanup

```markdown
# .claude/commands/release-finish.md

Complete git-flow release with full validation: $ARGUMENTS

Required:
- `<version>` - Version being released

Enhanced workflow:
1. Pre-finish validation:
   - Verify on release/<version> branch
   - Check working tree is clean
   - Validate VERSION file matches argument
   - Confirm all tests pass
   - Check code quality (linting, type checking)

2. Release completion:
   - Execute `git flow release finish <version>`  
   - Validate merge to main succeeded
   - Confirm version tag created
   - Verify develop merge-back completed

3. Post-release validation:
   - Check branch hashes match (main == develop)
   - Validate VERSION file consistency across branches
   - Confirm tag exists and points to correct commit
   - Push main, develop, and tags to origin

4. Cleanup:
   - Delete local release branch
   - Show final status report
   - Display GitHub release creation link

Error recovery:
- Automatic retry for failed merge-backs
- Clear instructions for manual conflict resolution
- Rollback procedures if process fails mid-way
```
